Yes, there are Visual Studio Code (VSCode) extensions that can help you automatically add file headers or templates to your React component files. Here are a few popular options that can achieve this:

1. File Header Comment Extension
Extension: File Header Comment

This extension allows you to define custom file headers for specific file types, such as React component files (.js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx).

How to Use:
Install the extension from the VSCode marketplace.

Open your VSCode settings (File > Preferences > Settings or Ctrl + ,).

Search for File Header Comment in the settings.

Configure the template with your custom header. Example configuration:

json
Copy code
"fileHeaderComment.templates": {
  "javascript": {
    "prefix": "/**",
    "suffix": "*/",
    "header": [
      "* @file   ${fileName}",
      "* @author ZCO Engineer",
      "* @date   MAR, 2022",
      "* @brief  React component module.",
      "*/"
    ]
  },
  "typescript": {
    "prefix": "/**",
    "suffix": "*/",
    "header": [
      "* @file   ${fileName}",
      "* @author ZCO Engineer",
      "* @date   MAR, 2022",
      "* @brief  React component module.",
      "*/"
    ]
  }
}
Now every time you create a new .js, .jsx, .ts, or .tsx file, the header will automatically be added based on your template.

2. File Header (allanoricil)
Extension: File Header

This extension allows you to add a customizable header to files when saving them. You can configure your own template and choose in which files the header should be included.

How to Use:
Install the extension from the VSCode marketplace.

Open the settings and look for File Header.

Configure the header template in your settings, something like:

json
Copy code
"fileheader.customMade": [
  "/**",
  " * @file   ${relativeFile}",
  " * @author ZCO Engineer",
  " * @date   MAR, 2022",
  " * @brief  React component module.",
  " */",
  ""
]
The header will be automatically added to files based on the configuration when you save them.

3. VSCode Snippets
You can also use custom snippets in VSCode for React component files, which is a built-in feature.

How to Set It Up:
Go to File > Preferences > User Snippets in VSCode.

Select JavaScript, TypeScript, or any other relevant language.

Add the following snippet configuration:

json
Copy code
"File Header Template": {
  "prefix": "fileheader",
  "body": [
    "/**",
    " * @file   ${TM_FILENAME}",
    " * @author ZCO Engineer",
    " * @date   MAR, 2022",
    " * @brief  ${1:Brief description}",
    " */",
    ""
  ],
  "description": "Insert a file header template"
}
Now, when you open any file, you can type fileheader and hit Tab, and the template will be inserted.

Conclusion:
For automatic insertion upon file creation or save, File Header Comment and File Header (allanoricil) extensions work great.
For manual template insertion using a snippet, you can leverage VSCode's built-in snippets feature.
Choose the approach that best fits your workflow.

To make the @brief section dynamic based on the file type (e.g., whether it's a React component, utility function, or Redux slice), you can use placeholders or dynamic content in VSCode extensions or snippets.

1. File Header Comment Extension (Dynamic @brief)
In the File Header Comment extension, you can use variables like ${fileName} or ${relativeFile} and customize it for different file types.

You can create multiple configurations based on file types:

json
Copy code
"fileHeaderComment.templates": {
  "javascript": {
    "prefix": "/**",
    "suffix": "*/",
    "header": [
      "* @file   ${fileName}",
      "* @author ZCO Engineer",
      "* @date   MAR, 2022",
      "* @brief  ${dynamicDescription}",
      "*/"
    ]
  },
  "typescript": {
    "prefix": "/**",
    "suffix": "*/",
    "header": [
      "* @file   ${fileName}",
      "* @author ZCO Engineer",
      "* @date   MAR, 2022",
      "* @brief  ${dynamicDescription}",
      "*/"
    ]
  }
}
Here, ${dynamicDescription} can be replaced manually when creating a new file. However, for more automation, you would need to manually modify the file header after it's generated, based on the context of the file.

2. Snippets (Interactive Placeholders)
If you're using VSCode snippets, you can make the @brief section dynamic by using interactive placeholders.

Go to File > Preferences > User Snippets.
Select JavaScript or TypeScript snippets based on your file type.
Add the following snippet configuration:
json
Copy code
"File Header Template": {
  "prefix": "fileheader",
  "body": [
    "/**",
    " * @file   ${TM_FILENAME}",
    " * @author ZCO Engineer",
    " * @date   MAR, 2022",
    " * @brief  ${1:React component, Utility function, Redux slice, etc.}",
    " */",
    ""
  ],
  "description": "Insert a file header template with dynamic @brief"
}
In this case, when you type fileheader and press Tab, it will insert the header with an interactive placeholder for the @brief field. You can type in something like "React component", "Utility function", or "Redux slice" based on the file type you're working on.

3. File Header Extension (allanoricil) with Dynamic @brief
You can configure this extension to include a dynamic placeholder for the @brief section.

Go to VSCode settings.
Add this configuration under File Header settings:
json
Copy code
"fileheader.customMade": [
  "/**",
  " * @file   ${relativeFile}",
  " * @author ZCO Engineer",
  " * @date   MAR, 2022",
  " * @brief  ${1:Brief description}",
  " */",
  ""
]
The ${1:Brief description} placeholder is an interactive tab stop, meaning you can replace it with the description relevant to the file when the file is created or saved.

Conclusion:
The dynamic part in the @brief section is achieved using interactive placeholders in snippets or extensions, where you can type a description such as "React component" or "Utility function" when inserting the template.

File Header Comment and File Header extensions allow some basic dynamic configurations but require manual input after generation.
VSCode Snippets give you an interactive placeholder to fill dynamically when inserting the header.
